PUNKIFY v1.0
====================================

> A fully on-chain identity system — evolving from Token ➝ NFT ➝ Name.

🌐 What is ERC-PIN?
--------------------

**ERC-PIN** is a next-generation Ethereum standard for **unique, verifiable, and fully on-chain Punk identities**.  
It begins as a token. It manifests as a Punk. It ends as a name.

Every wallet receives its own visual fingerprint, generated purely on-chain — no metadata servers, no IPFS, no compromise.

> "Not your PFP, not your name. This is your protocol-bound identity."

🔁 Lifecycle
------------

### 1. `ERC20 →` You Hold the Power  
Own $P — a token that acts as fuel and access.

### 2. `ERC721A →` You Claim Your Form  
Use $P to mint your **Punkify** — an on-chain SVG identity with randomized DNA.

### 3. `Name Service →` You Become Recognized  
Map your NFT to a name. Soon, your ERC-PIN NFT will link directly to a resolvable, verifiable name on Ethereum.

> Mint a soul. Own a style. Claim a name.

🧠 What Makes It Different?
---------------------------

✅ Fully On-Chain (SVG + Metadata)  
✅ Deterministic Design = True Ownership  
✅ Built on [ERC721A](https://www.erc721a.org/)  
✅ Modular Design → Extend to Domains / Voting / Identity Systems  
✅ Glows, Animations, Visual Fingerprint  
✅ EIP-compliant, Verifier Friendly

---

## 🌐 Identity Resolver API

Resolve Punkify identities by address or name.

- `GET https://punkify.org/api/resolver?address=0xYourWalletAddress`
- `GET https://punkify.org/api/resolver?name=username.p`

These endpoints return JSON metadata for identity status, NFT availability, and suggestions for next actions.

Use these in wallets, explorers, or dApps to fetch identity data.

Example:
```bash
curl "https://punkify.org/api/resolver?name=satoshi"
```

🚀 The Vision
--------------

> ERC-PIN is more than an NFT standard. It's an identity movement.  
> A step beyond JPEGs — this is **decentralized, stylized, and composable identity infrastructure** for the next web.

Imagine ENS, but born from the chain. Visual. Evolving. Immutable.

🧱 Stack
--------

- Solidity `^0.8.x`
- [ERC721AQueryable](https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A)
- OpenZeppelin Contracts
- Base64 SVG Metadata
- Fully deterministic trait engine (no IPFS)

📦 Contracts
------------

| Contract       | Role                    |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| `PunkifyNFT`   | The on-chain SVG identity generator (ERC721A) |
| `ERC20 $P`     | Fuel to mint your identity |
| `ERC-PIN`      | Future namespace resolver, Soulbound identity anchor |

🧭 Roadmap
----------

- ✅ ERC721A on-chain SVG Identity
- ✅ Metadata with full trait structure
- 🔜 Name Service Integration (ERC-PIN ↔ domain.eth)
- 🔜 Soulbound Mode (identity locking)
- 🔜 Punkify Indexer & Explorer
- 🔜 zkID Proof Integration → Prove your Punk identity without revealing your wallet.
  Unlock the next era of privacy-preserving on-chain reputation with zero-knowledge identity attestation. 
  Imagine: verifiable identity, no wallet doxxing, no compromise.
